I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu/) at Yale University, working with [Prof. Andre Wibisono](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono/) on theoretical analysis
of machine learning algorithms, in particular for problems in optimization and sampling.

Prior to Yale, I was an undergraduate student at Sun Yat-Sen University studying
Statistics and Logic. In my junior and senior years, I worked on machine learning
applications in genetics with Prof. Liming Liang at Harvard University and Prof. Yun Li at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
