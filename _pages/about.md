Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

My name is Kaylee. I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu/) at Yale University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhou Fan](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~zf59/) and Prof. [Andre Wibisono](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono). My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, the theory of machine learning, and statistical physics.


<!-- Prior to Yale, I got my BS in Statistics and BPhil in Logic from Sun Yet-Sen University (SYSU) in Guangzhou China. During my junior and senior years, I worked on machine learning applications in genetics with Prof. Liming Liang at Harvard Biostatistics and Prof. Yun Li at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) Biostatistics.
