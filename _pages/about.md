I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu/) at Yale University, working with [Prof. Andre Wibisono](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono/) on theoretical analysis
of machine learning algorithms, in particular for problems in sampling.

Prior to Yale, I was an undergraduate student at Sun Yat-Sen University studying
Statistics and Logic. In my junior and senior years, I worked on machine learning
applications in genetics with [Prof. Liming Liang](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/liming-liang/) at Harvard University and [Prof. Yun Li](https://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/) at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
