Welcome to my homepage!

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu/) at Yale University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhou Fan](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~zf59/) and Prof. [Andre Wibisono](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono). My research goal is to provide theoretical understanding of machine learning algorithms, in particular algorithms for sampling. My recent work focuses on score-based diffusion models and discrete sampling.

Prior to Yale, I got my BS in Statistics and BPhil in Logic from Sun Yet-Sen University (SYSU) in Guangzhou China. During my junior and senior years, I worked on machine learning applications in genetics with Prof. Liming Liang at Harvard Biostatistics and Prof. Yun Li at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) Biostatistics.
